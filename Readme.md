GitLab to GitHub Repository Migration Script

Overview

This script automates the migration of repositories from GitLab to GitHub, preserving all branches, commits, tags, and repository settings (public/private visibility). It supports bulk migration using a list of repositories.

Features

‚úÖ Migrates repositories while keeping full commit history.
‚úÖ Automatically creates repositories on GitHub with the correct public/private visibility.
‚úÖ Supports bulk migration from a repos.txt file.
‚úÖ Logs the entire process for easy troubleshooting (migration.log).
‚úÖ Cleans up temporary files after migration.

Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

Python 3+ installed.

A GitLab personal access token (PAT) with read_repository scope.

A GitHub personal access token (PAT) with repo scope.

Git installed on your machine.

Setup Instructions

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Andriy2025-out/gitlab-to-github-migration.git
cd gitlab-to-github-migration

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables

Store your GitLab and GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) as environment variables:

export GITLAB_TOKEN="your_gitlab_personal_access_token"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create repos.txt

List the GitLab repositories you want to migrate in repos.txt (one per line):

https://gitlab.com/group/repository1.git
https://gitlab.com/group/repository2.git

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Migration Script

Execute the script:

python migrate_repos.py

5Ô∏è‚É£ Check Logs

View migration.log to debug or verify the migration process:

cat migration.log

Troubleshooting

‚ùå GitHub repositories are created as private instead of public

By default, the script preserves the public/private status of GitLab repositories. If a migrated repository is mistakenly private, ensure your GitLab token has sufficient permissions to read visibility settings.

‚ùå Git push failed

Ensure your GitHub token has repo permissions.

Check if your repository already exists on GitHub.
